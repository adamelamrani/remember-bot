# remember-bot

This bot has been created purely for entertainment purposes. I have a friend who's notorious for recalling things said long ago. To make his life easier, I created this bot to spare him the hassle of scrolling through chat history.

## How to use

1. Add the bot to the chat
2. Type `/start` to initialize the bot
3. Answer to the message that you want to remember and just type `/remember`.
4. To get the messages that you have remembered from a user, use the command `/getMessagesFrom` {username} (it is important to add a space between the command and the username).
5. To get the last message remembered from a username, use the command `/getLastMessageFrom` {username} (it is important to add a space between the command and the username).
6. Type `/help` to get the list of commands.
